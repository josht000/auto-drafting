## Project Description

This repository contains the code for my bachelor thesis titled "Using Diffusion Models to Improve the Process of Floor Plan Drafting". The goal of this project is to explore the application of diffusion models in the field of floor plan drafting and evaluate their effectiveness in improving the efficiency and accuracy of the drafting process.

### Features

- Diffusion Model Implementation: The code includes the implementation of various diffusion models that can be used for floor plan drafting. These models are designed to simulate the spread of information and optimize the placement of different elements within the floor plan.

- Data Preprocessing: The repository provides scripts for preprocessing the input data, including floor plan images and relevant metadata. This ensures that the data is in a suitable format for training and evaluation.

- Training and Evaluation: The code includes scripts for training the diffusion models using the preprocessed data. It also provides functionality for evaluating the performance of the models based on metrics such as accuracy, efficiency, and convergence.

- Visualization: The repository includes tools for visualizing the output of the diffusion models. This allows users to gain insights into the placement of different elements within the floor plan and make informed decisions during the drafting process.

### Usage

To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Preprocess your floor plan images and metadata using the provided scripts.
4. Train the diffusion models using the preprocessed data.
5. Evaluate the performance of the trained models using the evaluation scripts.
6. Visualize the output of the diffusion models using the provided visualization tools.
